Asteroid - Neo Stats

Summary
Neo stands for Near Earth Objects. Nasa provides an open API and in this problem we will be
using the Asteroid NeoWs API.
We want to plot a line chart showing number of asteroids passing near earth each day for the
given date range as well as find the nearest asteroid and the fastest asteroid.
Data Source
NASA’s Open API -> api.nasa.gov
Neo Feed
Retrieve a list of Asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth
api.nasa.gov/api.html#neows-feed

Web Application
This should be a single page web application. Feel free to use any reactive JS libraries like
VueJS, AngularJS or anything you like. Use Twitter Bootstrap for the UI.
User Story
As a user, I want to select/enter start and end date so that I can view the Neo Stats for that date
range.
Provide a way (input) for the user to specify the start and end dates. Use a date picker for the
respective form fields.
Once the dates are selected, user will hit “Submit”. On Submit, fetch the Neo Feed from NASA’s
open API for the given date range and plot a graph showing total number of asteroids for each
day of the given date range. Use a bar or line chart for the same.

Also show the following stats (deduced from the data you will receive from Neo Feed)
1. Fastest Asteroid in km/h
2. Closest Asteroid
3. Average Size of the Asteroids in kilometers
Use chartjs.org to plot the chart.

Version Control
Put your source code in a Git repository (Bitbucket or Github) and share the URL to the same.

Deployment
Deploy the APP on free Heroku or AWS or Azure (or any other free cloud hosting provider) and
share the URL for testing. This is NOT compulsory but if you can do this, it will give you an
added advantage.

Notes
● You can refer respective manuals/docs
● You are free to get ideas from online but DO NOT copy/paste the code
